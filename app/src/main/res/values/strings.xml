        First, if you have not created an account, go the register page.
        \n\n
        If you have an account, sign in and either continue your game, or start a new game.
        \n\n
        The object of the game is to connect your pipe, labeled as such, to one of the finishing
        pipes, labeled with a pressure gauge.
        \n\n
        You take turns placing pipes on the board. You can only place pipes to your original pipe
        with your name. You must do this with no leaks or openings in the pipe.
        \n\n
        You can discard a pipe if you do not want this pipe to be picked and a new pipe will appear
        in its place. This will cost you a turn.
        \n\n
        If at any point you want to give up, you may press the surrender button.
        \n\n
        If you think you have a leak free connection, you may open the valve and see if you have
        won. If you open the valve and you have a leak, you lose.
        \n\n
        Good luck!
